Project for Task 3 of Software Engineering -> Arrivederci Procrastinazione
The Git-Hub repository was created on the 27/7/2025, however development of the website did not begin on this date.

As my project was on a different folder/files, I was required to bring some code over and was required to "copy and paste" certain parts.

Various sources was utilised to create the login/logout/user function and database as the Software Engineer of the project has very limited experience with Back-End engineering.
