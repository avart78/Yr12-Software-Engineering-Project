    Procrastination often creates a cycle of avoidance that leads to unfinished work and mounting stress. 
    When tasks are delayed, deadlines approach more quickly, forcing individuals to rush their work or struggle to complete it properly. 
    This last-minute pressure can result in lower-quality outcomes and a sense of overwhelm, making future tasks seem even more daunting. 
    Over time, this habit can lead to chronic stress, affecting both mental and physical well-being by increasing anxiety and reducing productivity. 
    Breaking free from procrastination requires self-discipline, structured planning, and an awareness of its negative effects—only 
    then can individuals reclaim control over their workload and minimize stress.
